2.0.2 : New build system, remove VERSION file
2.0.1 : Fix GC bug in JsonStringToGap, which would
        lead to spurious break loops.
2.0.0 : Improve unicode handling.
The Json package now ensures it only outputs valid UTF8. GAP strings which
contain valid UTF8 are outputted unmodified, invalid UTF8 is treated as Latin-1,
and transformed into valid UTF8.

1.1.0 : Fix bug in handling badly formatted integers
1.0.1 : Fix bug in nested structures
